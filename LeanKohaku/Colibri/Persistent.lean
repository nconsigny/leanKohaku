# Daemon-managed persistent Colibri client

Spawns the colibri sidecar in `--listen <socket>` mode and holds a UDS
connection for the daemon's lifetime. Solves the cold-start problem the
one-shot `--rpc` path hits: each invocation in one-shot mode pays the
sync-committee bootstrap (multiple seconds), so wiring it into reads like
`eth_getBalance` is impractical. With the persistent client, bootstrap
runs once per chainId per daemon lifetime.

The wire protocol is newline-delimited JSON-RPC over UDS:

  → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth.proxy","params":{...},"id":N}\n
  ← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":N,"result":...}\n

Trust posture is unchanged from the one-shot bridge: the sidecar is
**untrusted** for signing decisions; outputs render as confirmation copy
and the Lean side re-decodes signed txs through the existing path. The
delta is that a persistent client maintains committee state across calls,
so a compromised process has a longer leverage window. Mitigation: the
daemon re-checks every read result the same way it does today
(via re-decode at signing time), and the sidecar can be cycled by
restarting the daemon.

This module is the **only** place that spawns the sidecar in --listen
mode. The original `LeanKohaku.Colibri.Bridge.call` (--rpc one-shot) is
preserved for backward compatibility but should be considered legacy.
