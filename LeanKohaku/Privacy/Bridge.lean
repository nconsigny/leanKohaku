# Kohaku-bridge sidecar boundary

The Railgun and Privacy-Pools flows are implemented inside the npm packages
`@kohaku-eth/{plugins,railgun,privacy-pools}`. Reimplementing snarkjs witness
generation, libp2p (Waku), and the privacy-pools circuits in Lean is out of
scope, so we run them in a pinned Node sidecar (`leankohaku-kohaku-bridge`)
spawned by the daemon and addressed via line-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio.

The sidecar is **untrusted**: every prepared transaction it returns is
re-decoded by the Lean RLP / typed-tx / ABI code and gated through the
existing TPM-rooted signing path before broadcast. The bridge can never
exfiltrate plaintext key material because the response ADTs in this module
do not carry any spending-key bytes.

Network egress from the sidecar is policy-classified under the new
`shieldedRead` / `shieldedBroadcast` purposes in
`LeanKohaku.Privacy.NetworkPolicy`. Under `strictDaemonPolicy` shielded
purposes are denied; under `torDaemonPolicy` they are permitted only to
configured nodes via Tor.

This module is the **only** place that spawns the bridge.
