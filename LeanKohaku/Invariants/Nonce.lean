# Nonce monotonicity

Invariant: once the wallet has broadcast a transaction with nonce `k`
from an account, it must never sign another tx with nonce `≤ k` for
that account (without explicit replacement semantics we haven't
modeled yet). This prevents replay/replacement bugs.

We model the wallet state's "last used nonce" per account and require
that the next nonce is strictly greater.
