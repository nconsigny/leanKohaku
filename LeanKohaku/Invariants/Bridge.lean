# Bridge boundary invariants

The Node sidecar (`@kohaku-eth/{plugins,railgun,privacy-pools}`) is
**untrusted**. The wallet defends against it through three structural
properties proved here:

* **Purpose classification** — every `Bridge` method is mapped to a
  network-policy `Purpose`. Methods whose name encodes a broadcast
  intent map to `shieldedBroadcast`; everything else maps to a
  read-only purpose. This is the static skeleton of the planned
  invariant 5.7 (every bridge call factors through the policy).

* **Strict mode denies shielded egress** — the `strictDaemonPolicy`
  refuses any shielded purpose, regardless of peer/transport. This is
  the runtime safety net that prevents a misconfigured daemon from
  reaching out to Railgun relayers without an explicit `tor` mode.

* **Response/result disambiguation** — the JSON serialization of a
  bridge `Response` carries an `"ok"` boolean whose value uniquely
  identifies success vs. error vs. crash. The daemon cannot mistake a
  bridge crash for a successful proof.

The plaintext-key invariant (5.3) is enforced *by the type of
`Bridge.Response`*: there is no field carrying `ByteArray` key
material. That is a definitional property of the ADT and does not need
a theorem here.

Even in Tor mode, shielded traffic cannot leave the host directly or
target the local node, the local daemon, or arbitrary third parties.

/-! ## Response disambiguation

`responseToJson` projects every `Response` to a JSON object with an
explicit `ok` field whose value is `true` exactly when the bridge
returned a `result`, and `false` for both `err` and `crash`. The daemon
forwards this JSON to the CLI; the CLI cannot read a crash as success
without first ignoring the `ok` field. -/
